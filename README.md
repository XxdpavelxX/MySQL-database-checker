MySQL-database-checker
======================

Populate your database with "animal" and "food" tables using the tablepop and addfood programs that you wrote during the lesson (this step will not be necessary if you have not modified the tables since you created them in the lesson).   Write a program that verifies that every animal eats at least one food.
